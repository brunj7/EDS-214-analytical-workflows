Generally, there is one Driver who is the person typing at the computer. The other role is called Navigator(s). The Navigator does not write code and focuses on finding solutions to the problem.

We’ve found that drivers learn better this way, and they don’t just end up feeling like a stenographer. Whenever possible, we ask questions that lead the driver to discover the answers on their own.\nStay focused and be present: Shut your laptop and put your phone away. I’ve struggled with following this guideline—we all have—and I recognize that the distraction almost always affects the rest of the mob. We tell all our mob members to be present, and if you can’t, it’s OK to leave until you can be.\nUse a timer, but be ready to pause it: We switch drivers every 20 - 60 minutes. However, we often wander off implementation into design discussions—it’s unavoidable—so this is when we pause the timer. This is another key guideline of our mob: the time you spend driving should be dedicated to writing the code that helps complete the task, not discussing design solutions.\nSet specific tasks for each session: When our mob gathers for a session, we first agree on and create a checklist of the tasks we are going to complete, and order them by priority on a whiteboard. This ensures we are all focused on the same task and keeps us moving forward. Additionally, this keeps us aligned with Minimal Marketable Feature (MMF) work, which we can communicate with our engineering and product managers to assure them we’re completing tasks that align with developing small, self-contained features that demonstrate immediate customer value."

In this section we will talk about the case when your data sets start to be numerous or large enough that it is not possible anymore to keep them in your repository. Generally when you reach this amount of data to deal with, it also means that your personal computer might not be the best computer to efficiently process those data sets. Thus using a remote server (on premise or in the cloud) might become necessary.\n\nCodes should be managed using version controlled (git and GitHub for this course)   The repository should be stored in your home folder and the management of the different contributions should be resolved using git and GitHub and not by sharing directly the scripts. The main reason is that git does already the work for us by tracking the changes between the various versions, but also tracking which collaborator has made those changes and when.\nData sets should should be centralized in a shared folder that is available to all   It is very rare in an Environmental Data Science project that you will discover all the data you need from the start. In addition, a lot of environmental data sets are time-series, and one year later might need to be updated as your project progresses. Our goal here is to setup ourselves in a way that will help us to avoid duplication of data. Every time you duplicate a data set (for example on your own laptop), there is a risk that at some point it will become its own version."

    "text": "Scripting languages\nCompared to other programming languages (such as C, fortran, …), scripting languages are not required to be compiled to be executable. One consequence is that, generally, scripts will execute more slowly than a compiled executable program, because they need an interpreter. However, the more natural language oriented syntax of scripts make them easier to learn and use. In addition, numerous libraries are available to streamline scientific analysis.\n\nStructure of a script\nA script can be divided into several main sections. Each scripting language has its own syntax and style, but these main components are generally accepted:\nFrom the top to the bottom of your script:\n\nSummary explaining the purpose of the script\nAttribution: authors, contributors, date of last update, contact info\nImport of external modules / packages\nConstant definitions (g = 9.81)\nFunction definitions (ideally respecting the order in which they are called)\nMain code calling the different functions\n\n\n\nA few programming practices that will help a long way\n\nComment your code. This will allow you to inform your collaborators (but also your future self!) about the tasks your script accomplishes\nUse variables and constants instead of repeating values in different places of the code. This will let you update those values more easily\nChoose descriptive names for your variables and functions, not generic ones. If you store a list of files, do not use x for the variable name, use instead files. Even better use input_files if you are listing the files you are importing.\nBe consistent in terms of style (input_files, inputFiles,…) used to name variables and functions. Just pick one and stick to it!\nkeep it simple, stupid (KISS). Do not create overly complicated or nested statements. Break your tasks in several simple lines of code instead of embedding a lot of executions in one (complicated line). It will save you time while debugging and make your code more readable to others\nGo modular! Break down tasks into small code fragments such as functions or code chunks. It will make your code reusable for you and others (if well documented). Keep functions simple; they should only implement one or few (related) tasks\nDon’t Repeat Yourself (DRY). If you start copy/pasting part of your code changing a few parameters =&gt; write a function and call it several times with different parameters. Add flow control such as loops and conditions. It will be easier to debug, change and maintain\nTest your code. Test your code against values you would expect or computed with another software. Try hedge cases, such as NA, negative values, ….\nIterate with small steps, implement few changes at a time to your code. Test, fix, and move forward!\n\nWe hope this overview section about scientific programming has raised your interest in learning more about best practices and tools for developing reproducible workflows using scripting languages.\n\n\nNotebooks and scripts\nWith the increasing popularity of notebooks in scientific projects, it can sometimes be confusing to know when to use one. The good news is that there is not really a wrong or right here and that actually both can be used in a complementary manner and each data scientist will have her/his preference. However here are a few tips to help you decide:\n\nKeep your Notebook at a length you will feel comfortable reading. It if starts to be a long it might be time to think about if some code could be move to another document (scripts or another notebook)\nScripts might be better suited for tasks you need to rerun frequently\nIf you have developed many functions for your analysis, it might be worth storing them in a script outside your main notebook"

It is great practice to test them on a small project to see if hey could fit your project needs and way of working and collaborating. In this section we will go over a few R packages that could be of interest for your project.\n\nAn example: rrtols\n\nReproducible Papers\nA great overview of this approach to reproducible papers comes from:\n\nBen Marwick, Carl Boettiger & Lincoln Mullen (2018) Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends), The American Statistician, 72:1, 80-88, doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986\n\nThis lesson will draw from existing materials:\n\nrrtools\nReproducible papers with RMarkdown\n\nThe key idea in Marwick et al. (2018) is that of the “research compendium”: A single container for not just the journal article associated with your research but also the underlying analysis, data, and even the required software environment required to reproduce your work. Research compendia make it easy for researchers to do their work but also for others to inspect or even reproduce the work because all necessary materials are readily at hand due to being kept in one place. Rather than a constrained set of rules, the research compendium is a scaffold upon which to conduct reproducible research using open science tools such as:\n\nR\nRMarkdown\ngit and GitHub\n\nFortunately for us, Ben Marwick (and others) have written an R package called rrtools that helps us create a research compendium from scratch.\nTo start a reproducible paper with rrtools, run:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"benmarwick/rrtools\")\nrrtools::use_compendium(\"mypaper\")\n\nYou should see output similar to the below:\n&gt; rrtools::use_compendium(\"mypaper\")\nThe directory mypaper has been created.\n✓ Setting active project to '/Users/bryce/mypaper'\n✓ Creating 'R/'\n✓ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'\nPackage: mypaper\nTitle: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nAuthors@R (parsed):\n    * First Last &lt;first.last@example.com&gt; [aut, cre]\nDescription: What the package does (one paragraph).\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nByteCompile: true\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.1.1\n✓ Writing 'NAMESPACE'\n✓ Writing 'mypaper.Rproj'\n✓ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'\n✓ Adding '^mypaper\\\\.Rproj$', '^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n✓ Setting active project to '&lt;no active project&gt;'\n✓ The package mypaper has been created\n✓ Now opening the new compendium...\n✓ Done. The working directory is currently /Users/bryce\n\nNext, you need to:  ↓ ↓ ↓ \n● Edit the DESCRIPTION file\n● Use other 'rrtools' functions to add components to the compendium\nrrtools has created the beginnings of a research compendium for us. At this point, it looks mostly the same as an R package. That’s because it uses the same underlying folder structure and metadata and therefore it technically is an R package. And this means our research compendium will be easy to install, just like an R package.\nBefore we get to writing our reproducible paper, let’s fill in some more structure. Let’s:\n\nAdd a license (always a good idea)\nSet up a README file in the RMarkdown format\nCreate an analysis folder to hold our reproducible paper\n\n\nusethis::use_apl2_license() # Change this\nrrtools::use_readme_rmd()\nrrtools::use_analysis()\n\nAt this point, we’re ready to start writing the paper. To follow the structure rrtools has put in place for us, here are some pointers:\n\nEdit ./analysis/paper/paper.Rmd to begin writing your paper and your analysis in the same document\nAdd any citations to ./analysis/paper/references.bib\nAdd any longer R scripts that don’t fit in your paper in an R folder at the top level\nAdd raw data to ./data/raw_data\nWrite out any derived data (generated in paper.Rmd) to ./data/derived_data\nWrite out any figures in ./analysis/figures\n\nIt would also be a good idea to initialize this folder as a git repo for maximum reproducibility:\n\nusethis::use_git()\n\nAfter that, push a copy up to GitHub.\nHopefully, now that you’ve created a research compendium with rrtools, you can imagine how a pre-defined structure like the one rrtools creates might help you organize your reproducible research and also make it easier for others to understand your work.\nFor a more complete example than the one we built above, take a look at benmarwick/teaching-replication-in-archaeology.\n\n\n\nOther workflow frameworks to look into\n\nTarget\nThe target R package can be very useful if you have a complex workflow that is built of many parts that take time to rerun. Target can detect and run only the strict necessary steps to rerun when a specific change has been done to the workflow.\nHere for more: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/\n\n\nPointblank\nAlthough the pointblank package is mainly framed as a validating tool of the various part of your workflow, it provide a set of tools and great integration with the R Markdown ecosystem. It is also quite flexible making it possible to leverage this tool in a variety or project setups.\nhttps://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/"

    "text": "A fork is a copy of a repository that will be stored under your user account. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. We can create a fork on Github by clicking the “fork” button in the top right corner of our repository web page.\nMost commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else’s project or to use someone else’s project as a starting point for your own idea.\nWhen you are satisfied with your work, you can initiate a Pull Request to initiate discussion about your modifications and requesting to integrate your changes to the main repository. Your commit history allows the original repository administrators to see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request. Do this by going to the original repository and clicking the “New pull request” button!\nNext, click “compare across forks”, and use the dropdown menus to select your fork as the “head fork” and the original repository as the “base fork”.\nThen type a title and description for the changes you would like to make. By using GitHub’s @mention syntax in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.\nThis workflow is recommended when you do not have push/write access to a repository, such as contributing to a open source software or R package, or if you are heavily changing a project."

While the error messages from merge conflicts can be daunting, getting things back to a normal state can be straightforward once you’ve got an idea where the problem lies.\nThis is most easily avoided by good communication about who is working on various sections of each file, and trying to avoid overlaps. But sometimes it happens, and git is there to warn you about potential problems. And git will not allow you to overwrite one person’s changes to a file with another’s changes to the same file if they were based on the same version.\n\nThe main problem with merge conflicts is that, when the Owner and Collaborator both make changes to the same line of a file, git doesn’t know whose changes take precedence. You have to tell git whose changes to use for that line."

    "text": "How to resolve a conflict\n\nAbort, abort, abort…\nSometimes you just made a mistake. When you get a merge conflict, the repository is placed in a ‘Merging’ state until you resolve it. There’s a command line command to abort doing the merge altogether:\ngit merge --abort\nOf course, after doing that you still haven’t synced with your collaborator’s changes, so things are still unresolved. But at least your repository is now usable on your local machine.\n\n\nCheckout\nThe simplest way to resolve a conflict, given that you know whose version of the file you want to keep, is to use the command line git program to tell git to use either your changes (the person doing the merge), or their changes (the other collaborator).\n\nkeep your collaborators file: git checkout --theirs conflicted_file.Rmd\nkeep your own file: git checkout --ours conflicted_file.Rmd\n\nOnce you have run that command, then run add, commit, and push the changes as normal.\n\n\nPull and edit the file\nBut that requires the command line. If you want to resolve from RStudio, or if you want to pick and choose some of your changes and some of your collaborator’s, then instead you can manually edit and fix the file. When you pulled the file with a conflict, git notices that there is a conflict and modifies the file to show both your own changes and your collaborator’s changes in the file. It also shows the file in the Git tab with an orange U icon, which indicates that the file is Unmerged, and therefore awaiting you help to resolve the conflict. It delimits these blocks with a series of less than and greater than signs, so they are easy to find:\n\nTo resolve the conficts, simply find all of these blocks, and edit them so that the file looks how you want (either pick your lines, your collaborators lines, some combination, or something altogether new), and save. Be sure you removed the delimiter lines that started with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.\nOnce you have made those changes, you simply add, commit, and push the files to resolve the conflict.\n\n\nProducing and resolving merge conflicts\nTo illustrate this process, we’re going to carefully create a merge conflict step by step, show how to resolve it, and show how to see the results of the successful merge after it is complete. First, we will walk through the exercise to demonstrate the issues.\n\nOwner and collaborator ensure all changes are updated\nFirst, start the exercise by ensuring that both the Owner and Collaborator have all of the changes synced to their local copies of the Owner’s repositoriy in RStudio. This includes doing a git pull to ensure that you have all changes local, and make sure that the Git tab in RStudio doesn’t show any changes needing to be committed.\n\n\nOwner makes a change and commits\nFrom that clean slate, the Owner first modifies and commits a small change inlcuding their name on a specific line of the README.md file (we will change line 4). Work to only change that one line, and add your username to the line in some form and commit the changes (but DO NOT push). We are now in the situation where the owner has unpushed changes that the collaborator can not yet see.\n\n\nCollaborator makes a change and commits on the same line\nNow the collaborator also makes changes to the same of the README.md file in their RStudio copy of the project, adding their name to the line. They then commit. At this point, both the owner and collaborator have committed changes based on their shared version of the README.md file, but neither has tried to share their changes via GitHub.\n\n\nCollaborator pushes the file to GitHub\nSharing starts when the Collaborator pushes their changes to the GitHub repo, which updates GitHub to their version of the file. The owner is now one revision behind, but doesn’t yet know it.\n\n\nOwner pushes their changes and gets an error\nAt this point, the owner tries to push their change to the repository, which triggers an error from GitHub. While the error message is long, it basically tells you everything needed (that the owner’s repository doesn’t reflect the changes on GitHub, and that they need to pull before they can push).\n\n\n\nOwner pulls from GitHub to get Collaborator changes\nDoing what the message says, the Owner pulls the changes from GitHub, and gets another, different error message. In this case, it indicates that there is a merge conflict because of the conflicting lines.\n\nIn the Git pane of RStudio, the file is also flagged with an orange ‘U’, which stands for an unresolved merge conflict.\n\n\n\nOwner edits the file to resolve the conflict\nTo resolve the conflict, the Owner now needs to edit the file. Again, as indicated above, git has flagged the locations in the file where a conflict occcurred with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The Owner should edit the file, merging whatever changes are appropriate until the conflicting lines read how they should, and eliminate all of the marker lines with with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.\n\nOf course, for scripts and programs, resolving the changes means more than just merging the text – whoever is doing the merging should make sure that the code runs properly and none of the logic of the program has been broken.\n\n\n\nOwner commits the resolved changes\nFrom this point forward, things proceed as normal. The owner first ‘Adds’ the file changes to be made, which changes the orange U to a blue M for modified, and then commits the changes locally. The owner now has a resolved version of the file on their system.\n\n\n\nOwner pushes the resolved changes to GitHub\nHave the Owner push the changes, and it should replicate the changes to GitHub without error.\n\n\n\nCollaborator pulls the resolved changes from GitHub\nFinally, the Collaborator can pull from GitHub to get the changes the owner made.\n\n\nBoth can view commit history\nWhen either the Collaborator or the Owner view the history, the conflict, associated branch, and the merged changes are clearly visible in the history.\n\n\n\n\nMerge Conflict Challenge\nNow it’s your turn. In pairs, intentionally create a merge conflict, and then go through the steps needed to resolve the issues and continue developing with the merged files. See the sections above for help with each of these steps:\n\nStep 0: Owner and collaborator ensure all changes are updated\nStep 1: Owner makes a change and commits\nStep 2: Collaborator makes a change and commits on the same line\nStep 3: Collaborator pushes the file to GitHub\nStep 4: Owner pushes their changes and gets an error\nStep 5: Owner pulls from GitHub to get Collaborator changes\nStep 6: Owner edits the file to resolve the conflict\nStep 7: Owner commits the resolved changes\nStep 8: Owner pushes the resolved changes to GitHub\nStep 9: Collaborator pulls the resolved changes from GitHub\nStep 10: Both can view commit history"

Stage your changes, but before you commit, Pull again to see if any new changes have arrived. If so, they should merge in easily if you are working in different parts of the program. You can then Commit and immediately Push your changes safely. Good luck, and try to not get frustrated. Once you figure out how to handle merge conflicts, they can be avoided or dispatched when they occur, but it does take a bit of practice."

We do not tolerate harassment of class participants, teaching assistants, or instructors in any form. Derogatory, abusive, demeaning or sexual language and imagery is not appropriate or acceptable. Saying something “as a joke” does not make it less offensive, harmful, or consequential.\nAnything not covered here but that exists in the UCSB Student Conduct Code also applies, and will be enforced by UCSB Policy.\nThese expectations and consequences apply to synchronous discussions, office hours, the course Slack workspace, and all other modes of communication, posting or discussion by course participants.\n\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing an aware and respectful colleague (raise your hand when asked, respect others’ time and space, include peers in small discussions, don’t dominate meetings, etc.)\nGiving proper credit to the creator (of an idea/material/solution/etc.)\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nShowing empathy towards all community members\nUnderstanding that an individual’s experience and worldview are influenced by multiple (and often compounding) facets of their identity, and that your perception of a situation/topic/reaction may be very different from your classmates’\n\n\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by class participants include:\n\nDistracting other students in classes in labs, or otherwise distracting from their education\nAny abuse, disrespect or harassment of teaching assistants, other students, or teachers, is not tolerated and will result in disciplinary action as needed\nThe use of unwelcome sexual attention or advances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments or language, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\nMembers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns in or related to these classes, you are welcome to contact Allison or use outside resources.\n\n\nOther resources at UCSB\nAt Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (CARE) you can chat with a UCSB staff member in a confidential setting. CARE assists faculty, staff and students who have been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, and stalking.

Working as a team will leverage know-how from diverse collaborators and be the most efficient way to tackle complex problems in EDS. Consequently collaborative skills are required to work effectively as a member of a team. No matter their focus, highly effective teams share certain characteristics:\n\nRight size\nDiverse group of people with the right mix of skills, knowledge, and competencies\nAligned purpose and incentives\nEffective organizational structure\nStrong individual contributions\nSupportive team processes and culture\n\nSince Analytical Workflows are rarely linear! and are developed iteratively, the most efficient way to iterate quickly on your analysis is to use scripts and leave copy-pasting behind. Programming as part of a team is different than writing a script for your(present)self. However learning programming as part of a team is not only critical to the efficacy of your team, it will also you help you to grow as a programmer by:\n\nMotivating you to document well your work\nHelping you to think how to make your work reusable (by you, your future you and others)\nLearning to read code from collaborators to build upon each others work\nGain further knowledge in software development tools, such as version control\n\nDeveloping those skills will accelerate your research and open the door for you to contribute to open source projects."

    "text": "How to code together\nIt is important to acknowledge that there are many solutions to the complex research questions you will be facing in EDS. Each of those solutions will have several possible implementations, meaning that more likely you might code this implementation differently than your collaborators. Integrated software engineer teams generally try to mitigate this by developing coding standards and conventions that will guide how to write code and develop specific implementation. In scientific teams in which the collaboration is more loose and maybe more ephemeral as well, developing detailed coding standards will be too much of an overhead. However, we think it is important to acknowledge that coding style may varies among the data scientists of a project and it is a good discussion to have among the team at the beginning of the project. For example, in R it could be trying to use the tidyverse approach as much as possible. We also think there are two activities that will make the team more efficient: Code Review and Pair Programming.\n\nTools\nThe good news is there are several tools out there that have been designed to make developing code as a team more efficient. In this course, we will focus on getting familiar with the following:\n\nVersion control system: say goodbye to save as\nCode repository: where we share code and communicate ideas and feedback"

    "text": "Flow charts\nFlowcharts are useful to visualize and develop analytical workflow. It guides planning and anticipating the various computing and analytical tasks that will be required to complete an analysis. It also helps explaining the different steps to your collaborators and team. You can use a flowchart to spell out the logic behind a analytical workflow before ever starting to code. It can help to organize big-picture thinking and provide a guide when it comes time to code. More specifically, flowcharts can:\n\nVisualize the sequence of the different phases of the analytical process from data collection to implementing analyses\nBetter define the scope and resources needed both in terms of project data management and computing resources needed\nDiscuss who will be in charge and involved in the development of the different parts of the workflow\nList the products / outputs that will result from your analysis - such as data, codes, publications, web presence, … - and discuss how to best preserve and share them\n\nThere are conventions on how to use symbols to represent different parts of a workflow (see here for example). Although it is good to be aware of those conventions for sharing a workflow with your community, within a team the most important aspect is to be coherent and stick to this usage overtime.\nThe main benefit for the project is the process and discussion as a team to develop the workflow. It will ensure that everybody is on the same page and has the opportunity to provide inputs on the project. This workflow should be updated regularly as the project evolves.\nA few workflow examples\n\n\nPseudocode\nOften, programmers may write pseudocode as a next step, to provide greater detail than the flowchart in terms of processing steps and implementation. It will help you to define where iterations will be needed but also detect repeating blocks that might be well suited to be handled via the development of a function.\nThis technique aims at developing a sequence of pragrammatical steps in a manner that is easy to understand for anyone with basic programming knowledge. Pseudocode can be implemented more or less formally and at various levels of details. One additional advantage of going through this process is that it is agnostic of the tools / programming languages that you will be using to develop your analytical workflow.\nIn this course, we will be focusing on the process more than the exact syntax to use, keeping the level of details at a level that provide more details than a flow chart.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nWhat is a flowchart: https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial\nHow to write pseudocode: https://www.wikihow.com/Write-Pseudocode\nAn Introduction to Writing Good Pseudocode: https://towardsdatascience.com/pseudocode-101-an-introduction-to-writing-good-pseudocode-1331cb855be7\nHow to write Pseudocode: A beginner’s guide https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-write-pseudocode-a-beginners-guide-29956242698"

By default on a Linux server, you are located in the home folder. This folder is only accessible to you and it is where you can store your personal files on a server. You should see 2 folders: R and H\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R folder is where your local R packages will be installed, you can ignore it. The H is your H drive that the Bren School is offering to all its students. If you click on it you should see any files you have uploaded there.\nLet us make a folder named github by click on the New Folder button at the top of the tab. We will use this folder (also named directory in linux/unix terms) to clone any GitHub repository.\n\n\nR packages\nIf we go to the Packages tab, we can see a long list of packages that have already be installed by our system administrator (Brad). Those packages have been installed server wide, meaning that all the users have access to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nA user can also installed her/his own packages. Let’s try to install the remote package that lets you install R packages directly from GitHub: install.packages(\"remotes\"). Once done, note a new section that appeared on the Packages tab named User Library. Each of us have now its own copy of the package installed (in this R folder we were talking about a few minutes ago).\n\n\n\n\n\nA few notes:\n\nIn this example we will have made a better choice to have the remotes package installed once at the system level\nSome R packages depend on external libraries that need to be installed on the server. Those libraries will have to be installed by the system administrator first before you can install the R package\nInstalling an R package on a linux machine generally requires compilation of the code and will thus take more time to install than when you install it from pre-compiled binaries\n\nLook now inside you R folder!!"

It starts with using a consistent style withing your scripts (at least within a project).\n\nHere is a good style guide for R: https://style.tidyverse.org/\nStyle guide for Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\n\n\nimport this\n\nThe Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is better than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n\n\nThere is also the visual aspect of the code that should not be neglected. Like a prose, if you receive a long text without any paragraphs, you might be not very excited about reading it. Indentation, spaces, and empty lines should be leveraged to make a script visually inviting and easy to read. The good news is that most of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will help you to do so by auto formatting your scripts according to conventions. Note that also a lot of IDEs, such as RStudio, rely on some conventions to ease the navigation of scripts and notebooks. For example, try to add four - or # after a line starting with one or several # in an R Script!"

Make sure you cursor is inside the function you want to document and from RStudio Menu Code -&gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton\nExample:\n\n#' Add together two numbers\n#'\n#' @param x A number\n#' @param y A number\n#' @return The sum of \\code{x} and \\code{y}\n#' @examples\n#' add(1, 1)\n#' add(10, 1)\nadd2 &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n\nTry it! - Copy the function (without the documentation) in a new script - Add a third parameter to the function such as it sums 3 numbers - Add the Roxygen skeleton - Fill it to best describe your function\nNote that when you are developing an R package, the Roxygen skeleton can be leveraged to develop the help pages of your package so you only have one place to update and the help will synchronize automatically.\n\n\nPython Docstring\nA docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.\n\ndef complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):\n    \"\"\"Form a complex number.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    real -- the real part (default 0.0)\n    imag -- the imaginary part (default 0.0)\n    \"\"\"\n    if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0:\n        return complex_zero\n\nHere for more: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/"

It is because Notebooks provide space to further develop content, such as methodology, around the code you are developing in your analysis. Notebooks also enable you to integrate the outputs of your scientific research with the code that was used to produce it. Finally, notebooks can be rendered into various format that let them share with a broad audience.\nNotebooks are not only used within the scientific community, see here for some thoughts from Airbnb data science team."

This a very important topic for scientific reproducibility and for today we will be only provide a partial overview of this broader topic.\n\n\n\n\n\nData life cycle, DataONE\n\n\n\n\nMetadata (data about data) is an important part of the data life cycle because it enables data reuse long after the original collection. The goal is to have enough information for the researcher to understand the data, interpret the data, and then re-use the data in another study.\nHere are good questions to answer with your metadata:\n\nWhat was measured?\nWho measured it?\nWhen was it measured?\nWhere was it measured?\nHow was it measured?\nHow is the data structured?\nWhy was the data collected?\nWho should get credit for this data (researcher AND funding agency)?\nHow can this data be reused (licensing)?\n\nHow do you organize all this information? You could use a free form format, like a README file or spreadsheet. But there is also great advantage to use a more standardized way that will make the content not only Human readable but also machine readable. This will enhance the data discovery as specific information will be potentially tagged or attributed to specific aspect of your data (e.g. spatial or temporal coverage, taxonomy, …).\nThere are a number of environmental metadata standards (think, templates) that you could use, including the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), Geospatial Metadata Standards like ISO 19115 and ISO 19139, the Biological Data Profile (BDP), Dublin Core, Darwin Core, PREMIS, the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), and the list goes on and on."

It can be done more or less formally and this is an active area of research. For today we will be focusing on capturing the information about the data you are collecting. Here are a set of good questions to help you in that process:\n\nSource / owner (Person, institution, website, ….)\nWhen was it acquired ?\nBy whom on the WG ?\nWhere is it currently located (Google drive, server, ….) ?\nShort description of the data\nTrack if it is used in your analysis\n\nHere is a template of a data log that could hep to store this information\nAnother important and related aspect and also active field of research is data semantics. Often data sets store complex information and concepts that can be describe more of less accurately. Let’s take an example, you have receive a csv file storing a table with several variables about a fish stock assessment. One of the variable is named “length”. However there are many ways to measure the length of a fish. Which one is it?\n\n\n\n\n\nData semantics aims at clearly identify those concepts relying on vocabularies and ontologies, such as ENVO in environmental sciences. In addition, it enables the leverage relations between those concepts to help with (data) discovery."

But there are also other advantages, here are the main for scientist:\n\nPower: More CPUs/Cores (24/32/48), More RAM (256/384GB)\nCapacity: More disk space and generally faster storage (in highly optimized RAID arrays)\nSecurity: Data are spread across multiple drives and have nightly backups\nCollaboration: shared folders for code, data, and other materials; same software versions\n\n=&gt; The operating system is more likely going to be Linux!!\nMaterials\n\n\n\nCERN computing center"

The good new is that the syntax is very basic and it is easy to get started with. In addition, Markdown files (.md) are text files that can be opened by any text editor and can be easily be versioned. You can also render markdown document using pandoc into various document formats (PDF, html, ….). However it is important to be aware that there are several flavors of Markdown out there that are adding more capabilities to the basic one. For example GitHub has created its own flavor.\nAnother interesting feature of Markdown is that you can use html formatting when you want to do some more advanced formatting. In fact, document styles can be customized with HTML/CSS and math notation can be included using LaTeX or mathjax.\n$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$\n\\[\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\]\nDuring this flex session, explore what you can do with with Markdown basic\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\nAnd extended:\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/\n\nR Markdown\nWhat about R markdown in all of this?

    "text": "Course description\nThe generation and analysis of environmental data is often a complex, multi-step process that may involve the collaboration of many people. Increasingly tools that document and help to organize workflows are being used to ensure reproducibility, shareability, and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to the conceptual organization of workflows (including code, documents, and data) as a way to conduct reproducible analyses. These concepts will be combined with the practice of various software tools and collaborative coding techniques to develop and manage multi-step analytical workflows as a team.\n\nWhy going reproducible ?\nThere are many reasons why it is essential to make your science reproducible and how the necessity of openness is a cornerstone of the integrity and efficacy of the scientific research process. Here we will also be focusing on why making your work reproducible will empower you to iterate quickly, integrate new information more easily to iterate quickly, scale your analysis to larger data sets, and better collaborate by receiving feedback and contributions from others, as well as enable your “future self” to reuse and build from your own work.\nTo make your data-riven research reproducible, it is important to develop scientific workflows that will be relying on programming to accomplish the necessary tasks to go from the raw data to the results (figures, new data, publications, …) of your analysis. Scripting languages, even better open ones, such as R and python, are well-suited for scientists to develop reproducible scientific workflows. Those scripting languages provide a large ecosystem of libraries (also referred to as packages or modules) that are ready to be leveraged to conduct analysis and modeling. In this course we will introduce how to use R, git and GitHub to develop such workflows as a team.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow example using the tidyverse. Note the program box around the workflow and the iterative nature of the analytical process described. Source: R for Data Science https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n\n\n\n\nTwo points to stress about this figure:\n\nWorkflows are rarely linear… even less so their implementation\nNote the programming box – yes, you’ll need to code this :)\n\nWorkflows are developed iteratively, and one of the most helpful things you can do as a data scientist is to talk about them with your research team."

    "text": "Debugging\nThis section is adapted from the more detailed material available on the RStudio website: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio\nDebugging is a broad topic that can be approached in many ways. Generically, at some point you will likely attempt to execute a script in R, receive errors and not know exactly what caused the errors. One approach would be to run your code line by line, but RStudio has some useful built-in debugging features.\nOne basic approach to debugging is to create a breakpoint in your code – this forces your code to “stop” executing when it reaches some certain function or line number in your code, allowing you then to examine the state of various variables, etc. The easiest way to do this is to set the breakpoint by manually clicking next to the desired line number in the code panel, per this web example:\n\n\n\nhttps://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio#stopping-on-a-line\n\n\nSetting this editor breakpoint creates tracing code associated with the R function object. You can remove the breakpoint by clicking on the red dot by the line number. Also note the Debug toolbar has an option to clear all breakpoints.\nNote: keep in mind that you can’t set breakpoints anywhere. In general, you want to insert breakpoints at top-level expressions or simple, named functions.\nAn alternative way to set breakpoints is with the browser() function. This must be typed into your code, per this web example:\n\n\n\nhttps://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio\n\n\n(image source: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio#stopping-on-a-line)\n\nThe debugging interface\nOnce your code hits a breakpoint, RStudio enters debugging mode. Details on the debugging interface can be found here, but we summarize the main points below:\nThe Environment tab will display the objects in the environment of the currently executing function (i.e., the function’s defined arguments)\nThe Traceback literally traces back how you arrived at the currently executing function (latest executed command is at the top of the list). This is analagous to the “call stack” in other programming languages.\nThe Code window highlights the currently executing function and may create a new tab, named Source Viewer, when the current function the debugger is stepping through is not in the main R script.\nThe Console retains most of its normal functionality in debugging mode, but contains some additional buttons that appear at the top to facilitate moving through code lines (see below).\n\n\n\nDebugging buttons on the console\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nStart a new R Script\nWrite a function that computes the percentage of a number: n*p/100\nAdd a ratio factor as an argument so we can also use your function to compute 1/1000\nAdd a break point inside the function and use it to inspect local variables of your function"
